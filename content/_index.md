### intro 🚀

Hi there! I'm Jacob Sadowyj, an experienced Cloud Infrastrucuture Engineer, Software Engineer, and IT Professional with a passion for turning challenges into innovation.

### experience 💡

I've been at the forefront of some [seriously cool projects](/projects), such as leading the development of the NetSapiens Console (nsc), which dynamically builds IVR call-flow diagrams based on a series of API calls.

Having led application deployments, and executed large-scale migrations for large organizations (and U.S. government agencies). I can take applications from their infancy all the way to self-sustaning cloud architecture.
