### intro

Hi there! I'm Jacob Sadowyj, and I break things professionally so they don't break accidentally. As a Site Reliability Engineer, I turn coffee into uptime and chaos into carefully orchestrated systems that actually work.

### experience

I've been at the forefront of [infrastructure work](/projects) that keeps the lights on, from building monitoring systems that keep entire datacenters healthy to migrating production CDNs in record time thanks to infrastructure as code. 

My days are spent wrangling Kubernetes clusters, crafting Terraform modules, and making sure PostgreSQL databases stay happy under load. I love the challenge of taking a messy infrastructure problem and turning it into something elegant and automated.

From startups to government agencies, I've taken applications that were held together with hope and duct tape and transformed them into robust, scalable cloud architectures.

if that interests you 🤝 let's get [in touch!](mailto:jacob@sadowyj.net)
