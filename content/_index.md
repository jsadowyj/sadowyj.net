### intro

Hi there! I'm Jacob Sadowyj, and I break things professionally so they don't break accidentally. As a Site Reliability Engineer, I turn coffee into uptime and chaos into carefully orchestrated systems that actually work.

### experience

I've been at the forefront of some [seriously cool infrastructure projects](/projects), from building monitoring systems that keep entire datacenters healthy to migrating production CDNs in record time thanks to infrastructure as code. 

My days are spent wrangling Kubernetes clusters, crafting Terraform modules, and making sure PostgreSQL databases stay happy under load. I love the challenge of taking a messy infrastructure problem and turning it into something elegant and automated.

Having led application deployments and executed large-scale migrations for organizations and U.S. government agencies, I can take applications from their infancy all the way to self-sustaining cloud architecture.

if that interests you 🤝 let's get [in touch!](mailto:jacob@sadowyj.net)
