My dog Jakson and I

### background

First off, I know what you're thinking -- How do I pronounce my last name? The IPA pronunciation is "sÉ™dÉ”vÉªj" but I tell everybody it's "sado-vee" because that seems to roll off the tongue easier. 

I come from a family of eastern-european immigrants. Half of my family is Romanian ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´, and the other half is Ukrainian ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦. Having spent most of my life with my Romanian side of the family, I speak Romanian much better than Ukrainian.

### education

I graduated with an Associates of Applied Science in Computer Science before graduating high-school, and I'm currently pursuing Computer Science at Western Governors University. 

### hobbies

- programming
- language learning
- calisthenics
- crypto
- finance/economics
