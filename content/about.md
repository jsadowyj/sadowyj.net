## About

![me](/images/me.jpg)

_^ my dog Jakson and I_

### background 📚

First off, I know what you're thinking -- How does he prounce his last name? Short answer, translate Садове from Ukrainian. Long answer, it sounds like "sa-do-vey," but I tell everybody it's "sado-vee" because that seems to roll off the tongue easier. 

I come from a family of eastern-european immigrants. Half of my family is Romanian 🇷🇴, and the other half is Ukrainian 🇺🇦. Having spent most of my life with my Romanian side of the family, I speak Romanian much better than Ukrainian.

### education 🎓

I graduated with an Associates of Applied Science in Computer Science before graduating high-school _(that's a whole story on it's own)_, and I'm currently pursuing Computer Science at Western Governors University.
