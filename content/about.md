_^ my dog Jakson and I_

### background ðŸ“š

First off, I know what you're thinking -- How does he prounce his last name? Short answer, translate Ð¡Ð°Ð´Ð¾Ð²Ðµ from Ukranian. Long answer, it sounds like "sa-do-vey," but I tell everybody it's "sado-vee" because that seems to roll off the tongue easier. 

Although I was born in the USA, I come from a family of eastern-european immigrants. Half of my family is Romanian ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´, and the other half is Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. I speak Romanian fairly well, but I never had the chance to pick up Ukrainian.

### education ðŸŽ“

I graduated with an Associates of Applied Science in Computer Science before graduating high-school _(that's a whole story on it's own)_, and I'm currently pursuing Computer Science at Western Governors University. Having landed my first technical role at 17 years old, it was not easy to juggle working full-time and attending University of Michigan. I ultimately made the decision to switch to WGU, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

### hobbies ðŸ’ª

- coding (duh)
