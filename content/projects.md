Given a phone number, the NetSapiens Console (NSC) application traverses through PBX call routes, and dynamically generates an IVR chart. NSC has saved the organization hundreds of hours over the course of three years, and it is still being used to this day.

I wrote the backend Node.js and the front-end in React. It was the first project I ever worked on as a software engineering intern.
